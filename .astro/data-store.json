Digitize it! (And if I'm going to go through the trouble of scanning all these precious scribbles, we might as well have some fun along the way).\n\nOriginally I planned on simply snapping an image of the artwork in question and posting to an [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/infantartgallery) I created, with my own artsy-fartsy highbrow captions.\n\n\u003CImage src={toddlerInsta} alt=\"A starry night sky.\" />\n\nThis approach worked for about two posts before I quickly decided it wasn't worth the time and effort to craft some pseudo-intellectual art-babble for every piece.\n\n## AI to the Rescue\n\nAs it turns out, LLMs are quite good at vomiting prose, so I enlisted ChatGPT to help me out with my project. One of the benefits of using an LLM like ChatGPT is the ability to upload documents along with your prompt to query or extra data from them. I took advantage of this feature and uploaded an image of a drawing. ChatGPT did a surprisingly good job identifying particular characteristics about the image -- shapes, strokes, colors, etc -- and weaved them into the output. Check out the following example.\n\n### Image\n\n\u003CImage src={toddlerArtUpload} alt=\"Artwork uploaded to ChatGPT for analysis\" />\n\n### Prompt\n\n\"As a humorous exercise, create a highbrow artist statement for this piece of toddler art. Make it funnier by interpreting heavier themes that a toddler would clearly have no knowledge about. Use fancy art speak when possible.\"\n\n### Result\n\n> Title: \"Innocence Adrift in the Chromatic Sea\"\n>\n> This piece presents an unfiltered odyssey into the naive psyche, liberally splashed with a chromatic spectrum that defies the conventional palette. The artist—whose age belies their profound grasp of the human condition—explores the existential dichotomy of joy and chaos, manifesting in an abstract expressionist tour de force.\n>\n> With each stroke, the notion of a prelapsarian world emerges, where the untamed emotions are as vivid and untainted as the colors themselves. The central motif, a riotous explosion of pink and cerulean, might represent the clash of innocence against the inexorable tide of societal constructs.\n>\n> It's a commentary on the fragility of youth, an artful juxtaposition of the artist's unburdened beginnings against the complex backdrop of modern existential angst. The toddler's hand, ostensibly playful, channels a raw, uncorrupted vision of our world—a tableau untainted by the cynic's gaze.\n>\n> In sum, this work is a compelling narrative of formative expressionism, a bold declaration that the most profound insights often come from the minds of the purest among us.\n\nNow we're cooking!\n\nOne of the unexpected benefits of deferring the artist statement to the LLM was how it deftly identified characteristics about the image – shapes, strokes, colors, etc. – and weaved them into the output. This resulted in far richer, dynamic artist statements that the ones I had created previously.\n\n## From the 'Gram to the Gallery\n\nInitially, I figured I would just take the output from ChatGPT, copy and paste it into Instagram along side the artwork, and call it a day.\n\nThat lasted for about one post.\n\n\u003CImage src={toddlerArtInstaGpt} alt=\"Instagram post featuring ChatGPT artist statement.\" />\n\nMy vision for this project became grander. Why confine myself to the Instagram platform? What if I wanted to provide a multi-sensory experience and include narrated artist statements, as if the viewer were taking a guided audio tour? (Foreshadowing)\n\nI am a web developer, after all. I should be able to build this.\n\n![Don't let your dreams be dreams meme](https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExc2pwb2JqaDcybnYzNjZyZHN5eHYzcjNuYjgza210dXNmNzUzNHVnaCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/ACcXRXwUqJ6Ok/giphy.gif)\n\nIn the next post, we'll explore the technology and architecture behind the newest virtual art gallery, [MoMA](https://moma-boston.netlify.app/) (The Museum of Munchkin Art).
