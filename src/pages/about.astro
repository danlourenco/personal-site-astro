          <p>
            My professional journey spans over a decade working with organizations — from scrappy startups to Fortune 500 enterprises — with a focus on creating web applications that improve people's lives. I've led complete platform modernizations for national restaurant chains, built accessible government systems serving millions of citizens, and architected financial tools that help advisors better serve their clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            I approach every project with curiosity about the real problems we're solving and the people who will ultimately use what we build. This perspective, combined with my technical expertise in modern web technologies, accessibility standards, and JavaScript frameworks, allows me to deliver solutions that are both robust and impactful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about using technology to create positive social impact and improve people's lives. I believe technology should empower people, not manipulate them for engagement or profit. This philosophy guides everything from my approach to accessibility testing, to my choice of projects and the teams I want to work with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm seeking my next chapter with mission-driven teams — particularly in climate tech and sustainability — where thoughtful innovation meets meaningful impact. I want to contribute to solutions that don't just work well technically, but actually make the world a little better.
